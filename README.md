# Hi! My name is Eray Alp. 👋
I'm a Software Engineer specializing in **Infrastructure** and **Applied AI**, based in Istanbul, Turkey.

## About Me
I design, build, and operate cloud-native systems that power production services and ML workloads with a focus on reliability and scalability. I work at the intersection of **software engineering**, **AI/ML**, **infrastructure**, and **data pipelines**, blending engineering fundamentals with machine learning expertise.

Currently, I'm a **DevOps Engineer Intern at Codeway**, working across DevOps/SRE, platform engineering, and MLOps, powering global AI-powered apps used by millions.

Previously, I worked as an **ML Engineer Intern at sahibinden.com**, one of Turkey's largest marketplaces, where I helped transition high-traffic production systems from rule-based logic to LLM-powered services, building scalable inference pipelines with evaluation and monitoring.

Before that, at **Insider One**, I contributed to production-scale semantic search, large data ingestion pipelines, vector indexing, and hybrid retrieval systems.

### My key areas of interest:
- DevOps/SRE, Infrastructure & Platform Engineering
- MLOps, AI Inference & Training, LLMs
- Data Pipelines & Streaming Analytics
- Cloud Computing & Distributed Systems
